# resetlinux
a script in python3 to reset the setting and starting from fresh

##

The script will open a simple GUI window asking for the username. Enter the username you want to reset the configurations for and click the "Reset Configurations" button. The script will then perform the necessary actions, copying the contents of /etc/skel to the user's home directory and deleting the existing configuration files. Finally, a message box will be displayed indicating that the reset is complete.
